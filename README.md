# ntf-frontend

The frontend of the [Twitter Image Scraper](https://github.com/marcomartinscastanho/twitter-image-scraper) project.  
It displays the gallery of saved images.

It was once possible to publish selected images to an external blog, but that's no longer possible.  
Still, the code to do that was kept for purposes of future consultation.

The purpose of this project was to learn and practice useful technologies.

## Installing

In this directory, run `npm install`.  
Once that is done, you can start the frontend by running the `frontend.sh` script in the root folder.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the gallery in the browser.
